![Screenshot](Assets/sim.jpg)

This project allows users to place virtual furniture objects, such as a chair, a couch, or a table, in an augmented reality (AR) environment. The furniture objects are displayed on the user's phone, superimposed on the real-world view captured by the device's camera.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Unity 3D (version XYZ or higher)
- AR Foundation package
- ARCore (for Android) or ARKit (for iOS) support
- Android or iOS device with AR capabilities

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/AbdoRezki/Retail-AR-Application.git

2. Open Unity and select "Open Project." Browse to the cloned repository's folder and select it to open the project.

3. Once the project is opened in Unity, ensure that you have the necessary AR packages installed. If not, navigate to Unity's Package Manager and install the AR Foundation package along with the appropriate AR platform support package (ARCore for Android or ARKit for iOS).

4. Connect your Android or iOS device to your computer and set it up for development/testing with Unity.

5. Set up the AR build settings for your target platform (Android or iOS) by going to `File -> Build Settings`. Make sure to select the appropriate platform and adjust any other required settings.

6. Build and deploy the project to your connected device by clicking on the "Build and Run" button in the Unity editor.

## Usage
